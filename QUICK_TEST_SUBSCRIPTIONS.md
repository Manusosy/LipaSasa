## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invoice Limit Reached" not showing
**Check**:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM pricing_tiers WHERE name = 'free';
-- Verify max_invoices = 10
```

### Issue: Subscription not activating (M-Pesa)
**Check**:
1. Edge Function logs: `subscription-mpesa-callback`
2. Look for errors in callback processing
3. Verify admin M-Pesa settings are saved
4. Check `admin_payment_settings` table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM admin_payment_settings WHERE payment_gateway = 'mpesa';
```

### Issue: PayPal redirect fails
**Check**:
1. Admin PayPal settings saved correctly
2. `subscription-paypal` Edge Function logs
3. PayPal credentials are sandbox credentials (not live)

### Issue: Payment completed but plan not updated
**Check**:
```sql
-- Check subscriptions table:
SELECT * FROM subscriptions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check if profile updated:
SELECT user_id, selected_plan FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

---

## üìä Expected Database State After Tests

### After Test 2 (Invoice Limit)
```sql
-- Should have 10 invoices:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
-- Result: 10
```

### After Test 3 (M-Pesa Subscription)
```sql
-- Active subscription:
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' AND status = 'active';

-- Plan updated:
SELECT selected_plan FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
-- Result: "professional"

-- Can create more invoices:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
-- Result: 11+ (no limit on Professional plan)
```

### After Test 4 (PayPal Subscription)
```sql
-- PayPal subscription:
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' AND payment_method = 'paypal';

-- Plan updated to enterprise:
SELECT selected_plan FROM profiles WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
-- Result: "enterprise"
```
