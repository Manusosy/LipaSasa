# Signup Fix Complete ✅

## Issue
New user signup was failing with a `500 Database error saving new user` error. The error logs showed:
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "user_roles_user_id_role_key"
```

## Root Cause
The `handle_new_user()` database trigger was attempting to insert duplicate records into the `user_roles`, `profiles`, and `payment_methods` tables. This could happen when:
- The trigger fires multiple times in edge cases
- There's a race condition during user creation
- A previous failed signup attempt left partial data

The `user_roles` table has a UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, role)`, which prevented duplicate insertions and caused the entire transaction to fail.

## Solution
Updated the `handle_new_user()` trigger function to handle duplicate insertions gracefully using PostgreSQL's `ON CONFLICT` clause:

### Changes Made

1. **profiles table**: Added `ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET ...`
   - If profile already exists, update it with new values
   - Ensures profile data is always current

2. **user_roles table**: Added `ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING`
   - If role already assigned, skip the insertion
   - Prevents duplicate key error

3. **payment_methods table**: Added `ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO NOTHING`
   - If payment methods already exist, skip the insertion
   - Prevents duplicate entries

### Migration Applied
Migration name: `fix_handle_new_user_duplicate_role`

Applied on: 2025-10-27

## Testing
The signup flow should now work correctly. Test by:
1. Navigate to https://www.lipasasa.online/get-started
2. Complete all 5 steps of the onboarding flow
3. Verify account is created successfully
4. Check that profile, role, and payment methods are set up correctly

## Technical Details

### Database Function
The `handle_new_user()` function now includes:
- Idempotent inserts using `ON CONFLICT`
- Proper fallback logic for `owner_name` and `business_name`
- Support for both new format (first_name/last_name) and old format (owner_name)
- Comprehensive error logging with `RAISE NOTICE` and `RAISE WARNING`

### Error Handling
- Profile creation errors will still prevent user creation (re-raise exception)
- Role assignment errors will still prevent user creation (re-raise exception)
- Payment methods errors are logged but don't block user creation (can be created later)

## Files Modified
- Database: `handle_new_user()` function via migration `fix_handle_new_user_duplicate_role`

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Signup flow should now work correctly without database errors.

**Next Steps:**
- Test the signup flow end-to-end
- Monitor auth logs for any new errors
- Consider adding frontend retry logic for transient errors
