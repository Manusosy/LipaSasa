# Payment Links & UX Improvements âœ…

## Summary
Successfully completed all merchant dashboard improvements including fixing M-Pesa payment link functionality, enhancing UI/UX, updating icons, and optimizing page loading performance.

---

## 1. âœ… M-Pesa Payment Link STK Push - FIXED

### Problem
Payment links were not triggering M-Pesa STK Push when merchants entered their phone numbers. The Edge Function was using placeholder/aggregator code instead of actual M-Pesa Daraja API integration.

### Solution
- **Updated `payment-link-stk` Edge Function** to use merchant's M-Pesa credentials from `mpesa_credentials` table
- **Added `environment` field** to `mpesa_credentials` table to support both sandbox and production environments
- **Integrated with Safaricom Daraja API** for real STK Push functionality:
  - OAuth token generation
  - STK Push request with proper payload
  - Transaction recording in database
  - Callback URL configuration

### Files Modified
- `supabase/functions/payment-link-stk/index.ts` - Complete rewrite to use Daraja API
- Database migration: `add_environment_to_mpesa_credentials` - Added environment field

### Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Payment Methods â†’ M-Pesa Daraja Setup
2. Configure your M-Pesa credentials (shortcode, consumer key, consumer secret, passkey)
3. Create a payment link via Dashboard â†’ Payment Links
4. Open the payment link and enter a phone number
5. STK Push should now trigger on the phone! ðŸ“±

## 2. âœ… Payment Link Dialog UI Improvements

- **Clean Layout** with proper spacing and readable font for link URL

### User Flow

2. Fill in payment link details
3. Click "Create Link"
4. âœ¨ **NEW**: Beautiful success dialog appears with:
   - Link URL in a readable input field
   - Copy button for instant clipboard copy

   - Done button to close

### Files Modified

## 4. âœ… Dashboard Page Icons

### Updated Icons
All merchant dashboard pages now have proper, intuitive icons:

| Page | Old Icon | New Icon | Icon Name |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Dashboard | LayoutDashboard | LayoutDashboard | âœ… Already good |
| Invoices | FileText | FileText | âœ… Already good |
| Payment Links | FileText | Link2 | ðŸ”— Link icon |

### Files Modified

## 5. âœ… Loading Performance Optimization

### Problem
Full-screen loading spinners were blocking the entire page, creating a poor user experience with long perceived loading times.

### Solution
- **Removed full-screen loading spinners** from all merchant dashboard pages
- **Added skeleton loaders** where appropriate (e.g., Payment Links page)
- **Instant layout rendering** - users see the page structure immediately
- **Progressive loading** - data loads in without blocking the UI

### Benefits
- âš¡ **Faster perceived performance** - layout appears instantly
- ðŸŽ¯ **Better UX** - no jarring full-screen spinners
- ðŸ“± **Smoother transitions** between dashboard pages
- âœ¨ **Professional feel** - modern app-like experience

### Files Modified
All merchant dashboard pages:
- `src/pages/dashboard/SellerDashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/PaymentLinks.tsx` (with skeleton loaders)
- `src/pages/dashboard/PaymentMethods.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/Settings.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/Subscription.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboard/ApiIntegrations.tsx`
