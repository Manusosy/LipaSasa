## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Check Edge Function Logs
```
Supabase Dashboard → Functions → [function-name] → Logs tab
```

### Common Issues

**"M-PESA credentials not found"**
→ Complete Step 2 above

**"Failed to authenticate"**
→ Double-check Consumer Key/Secret match Safaricom app

**"Invalid phone number"**
→ Use format: `254708374149` (Kenya only)

**STK not received**
→ Verify shortcode matches passkey in Safaricom app

**Callback not firing**
→ Check `mpesa-callback` function logs, verify no errors
