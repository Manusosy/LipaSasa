# M-Pesa Payment System - Ready for Deployment ✅

## What's Been Completed

### 1. ✅ Database Migrations Applied
All 12 migrations have been successfully applied to your Supabase database:
- Pricing tiers with currency support
- Subscription tracking enhancements
- Admin/merchant separation with RLS policies
- Admin payment settings table
- M-Pesa credentials table
- Performance optimizations

### 2. ✅ M-Pesa Credentials Setup UI Created
**New Feature**: Merchants can now configure their Daraja API credentials!

**Location**: Payment Methods page → M-Pesa Daraja API Credentials section

**Features**:
- ✅ Environment selection (Sandbox/Production)
- ✅ Secure credential input (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Passkey, Shortcode)
- ✅ Nominated phone number for B2C notifications
- ✅ Test Connection button (validates credentials with Safaricom API)
- ✅ Toggle to enable/disable STK Push
- ✅ Encrypted storage in `mpesa_credentials` table

**How it works**:
1. Merchant visits Payment Methods
2. Scrolls to "M-Pesa Daraja API Credentials" card
3. Selects environment (Sandbox for testing)
4. Enters their Safaricom API credentials
5. Clicks "Test Connection" to verify
6. Saves credentials
7. Enables STK Push toggle

### 3. ✅ Edge Functions Deployed

**Deployed Functions** (6/11):
1. ✅ `mpesa-stk-push` (v3) - Invoice payments, supports sandbox/production
2. ✅ `mpesa-callback` (v2) - M-Pesa payment callbacks
3. ✅ `payment-link-stk` (v1) - Payment link STK Push
4. ✅ `payment-link-callback` (v1) - Payment link callbacks
5. ✅ `subscription-mpesa` (v1) - Subscription payments via M-Pesa
6. ✅ `subscription-mpesa-callback` (v1) - Subscription payment callbacks

**Updated Features**:
- ✅ All functions read credentials from database (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Environment-aware (sandbox vs production)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Transaction logging to `transactions` table
- ✅ Subscription history tracking
- ✅ Profile plan updates on successful payment

### 4. ✅ Fixed Subscription Edge Functions
**Previous Issue**: Subscription functions looked for credentials in `admin_settings` table under `mpesa_subscription_credentials` key.

**Fix**: Updated to read from `admin_payment_settings` table with `payment_gateway = 'mpesa'`.

**Impact**: Admin Settings page (M-Pesa tab) now connects properly to subscription Edge Functions.

## How the Payment Flow Works Now

### Invoice Payment Flow
```
1. Merchant creates invoice via Invoices page
2. Customer visits /pay/:invoiceId
3. Customer enters phone number
4. Frontend calls mpesa-stk-push Edge Function (with merchant's JWT)
5. Edge Function:
   - Fetches merchant's mpesa_credentials from database
   - Gets OAuth token from Safaricom
   - Sends STK Push to customer's phone
   - Records transaction in database (status: pending)
6. Customer enters M-Pesa PIN on phone
7. Safaricom sends callback to mpesa-callback Edge Function
8. Callback updates transaction status (completed/failed)
9. Frontend polls transaction status and shows result
```

### Payment Link Flow
```
1. Merchant creates payment link via Payment Links page
2. Customer visits /pay/link/:slug
3. Customer enters amount (≥ min_amount) and phone number
4. Frontend calls payment-link-stk Edge Function (no auth required)
5. Edge Function:
   - Fetches payment link and merchant_id
   - Fetches merchant's mpesa_credentials
   - Sends STK Push
   - Records transaction
6. Callback updates transaction
7. Customer sees success/failure
```

### Subscription Payment Flow
```
1. Merchant visits Subscription page
2. Selects plan and billing cycle
3. Chooses M-Pesa payment method
4. Enters phone number
5. Frontend calls subscription-mpesa Edge Function
6. Edge Function:
   - Fetches admin M-Pesa settings from admin_payment_settings
   - Sends STK Push for subscription amount
   - Records in subscriptions and subscription_history tables
7. Callback updates subscription status, plan in profiles, and creates transaction
```

## Security Advisories (Non-Critical)

From Supabase linter:

1. **Function search_path mutable** (8 functions)
   - Impact: Low security risk
   - Fix: Add `SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public, pg_temp` to functions
   - Priority: Low (can fix later)

2. **Auth OTP long expiry**
   - Current: > 1 hour
   - Recommended: < 1 hour
   - Fix: In Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email OTP expiry

3. **Leaked password protection disabled**
   - Recommendation: Enable HaveIBeenPwned integration
   - Fix: Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Password settings

4. **Postgres version has patches**
   - Current: 17.4.1.074
   - Fix: Upgrade database in Supabase Dashboard

---

## Environment Variables Needed

Your Edge Functions need these environment variables (auto-configured by Supabase):
- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL` - Auto-set
- ✅ `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Auto-set
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Auto-set

**No manual secrets needed!** All credentials are stored in database tables.

---

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Deploy via Cursor (Recommended)
```bash
# You're already using Supabase MCP, so Edge Functions are deployed!
# Just ensure the frontend is built and deployed:

npm run build
# Deploy dist/ to your hosting provider (Vercel/Netlify/etc)
```

### Option B: Manual Supabase Deployment
```bash
# If you need to redeploy functions manually:
supabase functions deploy mpesa-stk-push
supabase functions deploy mpesa-callback
supabase functions deploy payment-link-stk
supabase functions deploy payment-link-callback
supabase functions deploy subscription-mpesa
supabase functions deploy subscription-mpesa-callback
```
