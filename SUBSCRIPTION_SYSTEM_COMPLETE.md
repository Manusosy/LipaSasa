# Subscription System Complete ✅

## Summary of Changes

All requested features have been implemented and deployed:

### 1. ✅ Removed Plan Selection from Signup
**What Changed**:
- Plan selection step removed from onboarding flow
- Users now default to **Free plan** automatically
- Onboarding reduced from 3 steps to 2 steps (Business Info → Review)
- No UI clutter during signup - clean, simple flow

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/onboarding/GetStarted.tsx`
  - Removed PlanSelectionStep component
  - Set `selected_plan: 'free'` hardcoded
  - Updated `totalSteps = 2`

**Impact**: New users can sign up faster without being pressured to choose a plan upfront.

---

### 2. ✅ Enforced 10 Invoice Limit for Free Plan
**What Changed**:
- Before creating an invoice, system now checks:
  - User's current plan
  - Plan's `max_invoices` limit from `pricing_tiers` table
  - Count of existing invoices for that user
- If limit reached (10 for Free plan), user sees error toast and is auto-redirected to `/dashboard/subscription` after 2 seconds

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/dashboard/CreateInvoiceDialog.tsx`
  - Added plan limit check before invoice creation
  - Fetches `pricing_tiers.max_invoices`
  - Counts user's invoices
  - Shows upgrade prompt if limit exceeded

**Error Message Example**:
```
Invoice Limit Reached
You've reached the maximum of 10 invoices on the Free plan. 
Please upgrade your subscription to create more invoices.
```

**Impact**: Free plan users must upgrade to continue transacting after 10 invoices.

---

### 3. ✅ Fixed Payment Link Avatars
**What Changed**:
- Payment links (`/pay/link/:slug`) now show **LipaSasa logo** instead of letter placeholder
- Falls back to favicon if custom `logo_url` is not set or fails to load

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/PaymentPage.tsx`
  - Changed from conditional letter avatar to `<img src={link.logo_url || '/lipasasa-logo.png'} />`
  - Added `onError` fallback to `/favicon.ico`

**Before**: Placeholder circle with "T" (first letter of title)  
**After**: LipaSasa logo displayed prominently

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed Subscription M-Pesa Integration
**What Changed**:
- Frontend now sends correct parameters to Edge Function:
  - `user_id`, `plan_name`, `amount`, `phone_number`, `currency`
- M-Pesa Edge Function (`subscription-mpesa`) reads from `admin_payment_settings` table
- After successful payment, callback updates:
  - `subscriptions` table → `status: 'active'`
  - `profiles` table → `selected_plan: <new_plan>`
  - `subscription_history` table → `status: 'completed'`
  - `transactions` table → audit record created

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/dashboard/Subscription.tsx`
  - Updated M-Pesa payload to match Edge Function expectations
  - Proper parameter names (`plan_name` not `plan`)
- `supabase/functions/subscription-mpesa/index.ts` (already updated earlier)
- `supabase/functions/subscription-mpesa-callback/index.ts` (already updated earlier)

**Edge Functions Deployed**:
- `subscription-mpesa` (v1) ✅
- `subscription-mpesa-callback` (v1) ✅

**Flow**:
1. User selects Professional plan → Monthly billing → M-Pesa
2. Enters phone number → Clicks Subscribe
3. STK Push sent to phone
4. User enters M-Pesa PIN
5. Callback received → Plan activated in profile
6. User can now create unlimited invoices (Professional plan)

### 5. ✅ Fixed Subscription PayPal Integration
**What Changed**:
- PayPal Edge Function now reads from `admin_payment_settings` table (not `admin_settings`)
- Frontend sends correct parameters: `user_id`, `plan_name`, `amount`, `currency: 'USD'`
- PayPal order created with approval URL
- User redirected to PayPal to complete payment
- Webhook handles payment completion and activates plan

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/dashboard/Subscription.tsx`
  - Updated PayPal payload to match Edge Function
  - Uses USD currency for PayPal
- `supabase/functions/subscription-paypal/index.ts`
  - **NEW**: Reads from `admin_payment_settings` table
  - Fetches `client_id`, `client_secret`, `mode` (test/live)
  - Creates PayPal order
  - Returns `approval_url` for redirect
- `supabase/functions/subscription-paypal-webhook/index.ts`
  - **NEW**: Updates `subscription_history` table
  - Handles `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED` and `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED` events
  - Updates user profile plan on successful payment

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No subscription cancellation** - Users cannot downgrade/cancel subscriptions yet
2. **No subscription history UI** - `subscription_history` table exists but not displayed
3. **No auto-renewal** - Subscriptions expire after 30 days, no automatic renewal
4. **No proration** - Upgrading mid-cycle doesn't calculate prorated refunds
5. **PayPal webhooks require manual setup** - Admin must configure in PayPal Dashboard

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. Add subscription management (cancel/downgrade/renew)
2. Display subscription history in UI
3. Implement auto-renewal with reminders
4. Add proration calculator for mid-cycle upgrades
5. Automate PayPal webhook registration via API
6. Send email receipts after successful payments
7. Add plan comparison chart on subscription page
8. Implement trial periods (7-day free trial)

## Error Handling

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "PayPal payment gateway not configured"  
**Solution**: Admin must configure PayPal in Settings → PayPal tab

**Issue**: "M-Pesa payment gateway not configured"  
**Solution**: Admin must configure M-Pesa in Settings → M-Pesa tab

**Issue**: Payment completed but plan not activated  
**Solution**: Check Edge Function logs:
```bash
# Supabase Dashboard → Functions → subscription-mpesa-callback → Logs
# or
# Supabase Dashboard → Functions → subscription-paypal-webhook → Logs
```

**Issue**: Invoice limit still enforced after upgrade  
**Solution**: Plan update may not have propagated. Check:
1. `profiles` table → `selected_plan` column
2. Refresh page to reload user profile
3. Check Edge Function logs for errors

---

## Security Notes

✅ **Secure**:
- PayPal credentials stored in `admin_payment_settings` (admin-only access)
- M-Pesa credentials stored in `mpesa_credentials` (merchant self-service) and `admin_payment_settings` (for subscriptions)
- Edge Functions use service role key (not exposed to frontend)
- RLS policies enforce access control

⚠️ **Recommendations**:
- Enable Supabase Vault for encrypting sensitive credentials
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Monitor Edge Function logs for suspicious activity
- Use webhook signature verification (PayPal supports this)

---
